PURPOSE:

These files should help you to understand how your concurrency assignment will
be graded. We'll generate outputs to files, and then check them with this java
class (or an updated version, as need be). Hopefully by using it ahead of time,
you'll be sure you're getting the correct formatting, and grading and grades will
all benefit as a result.


################################################################################

TO RUN:

 - generate your output, put it in a file:

	commandLine voodoo N M  >  sampleout.txt


 - compile the checker:

	javac DanceCardChecker.java


 - run the DanceCardChecker

	java DanceCardChecker sampleout.txt N M

SHARED TEST CASES

We have some test cases provided here - by running the DanceCardChecker on them,
you can get a sense of how the error messages would respond. Your program is 
supposed to create things like these, but is never expected to generate these
exact outputs. Especially since most of them are bad!



Consistent outputs:

good1.txt : 4x4
good2.txt : 4x6


Inconsistent outputs:

FollowerInDanceTwice.txt : 4x4
 - F3 is dancing the Tango with L1 and L2
 - Forgetful!

LeaderInDanceTwice.txt   : 4x4
 - L1 is dancing the Waltz twice (With F2, F3)
 - Duplicitous!

MissedOpportunities.txt  : 4x4
 - L3, F1 aren't dancing the Cha Cha when they could
 - Regrets!

TooMuchSamePartner.txt   : 2x2
 - L1 and F1 are dancing everything together
 - Antisocial!
